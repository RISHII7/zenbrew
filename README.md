# Zenbrew

My personal web application project showcases a modern approach to coffee shop presentation using React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion and GSAP technologies.

The application consists of eight sections, starting with a Header that includes navigation to seamlessly guide users through the site. Following the Header, the Hero section captivates visitors with a video background that highlights the ambiance of the coffee shop. The Explore section then showcases the unique advantages and offerings of the establishment.

The About section provides insight into journey, promise to customers, and introduces dedicated team. The Menu section features a comprehensive list of all the coffees and delicacies offered by the shop. Subsequently, the Opening Hours section provides essential information about when the shop is opened to serve our customers.

The Testimonials section shares feedback from satisfied patrons, adding credibility and a personal touch to the presentation. Finally, the Footer section wraps up the application with additional navigation and contact information.

This project not only demonstrates my frontend development skills but also highlights my ability to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences tailored for the coffee shop industry.
